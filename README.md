# 👋 Hey, I’m Boswell Orendain  

🚀 Full-Stack Engineer | Systems Architect | Indie SaaS Builder  

I design and build **production-grade systems** from the ground up — from developer toolchains and scalable APIs to self-hosted cloud infrastructure. My work blends **system design, DevOps, and developer experience (DX)** with a focus on simplicity, scalability, and freedom from vendor lock-in.

## 💻 My Current Software
- **🍱 Bento** — CLI + SaaS for spinning up **production-ready stacks** in minutes.  
- **🎮 MMORPG** — A modular online RPG with scalable combat, quest, and reward systems.  
- **📚 Anima** — CMS + API platform for lore, stories, and patch notes.  
- **☁️ Atlas** — My self-hosted home lab (64GB RAM) running 20+ Dockerized apps, CI/CD pipelines, NGINX reverse proxies, and MariaDB with TLS.

## 🔧 My Toolbox
- **Languages:** TypeScript, Go, PHP (Laravel), Lua, Python

- **Backend:** Laravel, Node.js, REST APIs, JWT Auth  
- **DevOps / Infra:** Docker, NGINX, GitHub Actions CI/CD, MariaDB/Postgres, Cloudflare, TLS/SSL

✨ *I’m obsessed with turning complex systems into tools that feel simple — whether it’s helping developers skip infrastructure headaches or scaling games to thousands of players.*
