# 👋 Hey, I’m Boswell Orendain  

🚀 Full-Stack Engineer | Systems Architect | Indie SaaS Builder  

I design and build **production-grade systems** from the ground up — from developer toolchains and scalable APIs to self-hosted cloud infrastructure. My work blends **system design, DevOps, and developer experience (DX)** with a focus on simplicity, scalability, and freedom from vendor lock-in.

## 💻 My Current Software
- **☁️ Atlas** — My self-hosted private cloud running 20+ Dockerized apps, CI/CD pipelines, NGINX reverse proxies, and MariaDB with TLS.  
- **🍱 Bento** — CLI + SaaS for spinning up **production-ready stacks** in minutes.  
- **📚 Anima** — CMS + API platform for lore, stories, and patch notes.

## 🔧 My Toolbox
- **Languages:** TypeScript, Go, PHP (Laravel), Lua, Python  
- **Frontend:** React, Vue 3, Tailwind, Vite  
- **Backend:** Laravel, Node.js, REST APIs, JWT Auth  
- **DevOps / Infra:** Docker, NGINX, GitHub Actions CI/CD, MariaDB/Postgres, Cloudflare, TLS/SSL  
- **Cloud Computing:** Self-hosted on **Atlas** today, expanding to **DigitalOcean droplets** and beyond when scaling demands.  
- **Architecture:** Modular design, design patterns (Singleton, Observer, Factory, Strategy), distributed systems  

---

## 🌱 Current Focus
- Scaling **Bento** into a lightweight SaaS with recurring revenue.  
- Building and expanding my **MMORPG** with extensible systems.  
- Refining **Atlas** into a showcase of self-hosted, production-grade infra.  
- Expanding into **cloud deployments** with DigitalOcean as Bento adoption grows.

✨ *I’m obsessed with turning complex systems into tools that feel simple — whether it’s helping developers skip infrastructure headaches or scaling games to thousands of players.*
